**Big-Mart-Sales-Predicition**
The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store. Create a model by which Big Mart can analyse and predict the outlet production sales.

A perfect project to learn Data Analytics and apply Machine Learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XG Boost) to predict the outlet production sales.
Mini Project 2-A

**Dataset Description**
BigMart has collected sales data from the year 2013, for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Where the dataset consists of 12 attributes like Item Fat, Item Type, Item MRP, Outlet Type, Item Visibility, Item Weight, Outlet Identifier, Outlet Size, Outlet Establishment Year, Outlet Location Type, Item Identifier and Item Outlet Sales. Out of these attributes response variable is the Item Outlet Sales attribute and remaining attributes are used as the predictor variables.

The data-set is also based on hypotheses of store level and product level. Where store level involves attributes like:- city, population density, store capacity, location, etc and the product level hypotheses involves attributes like:- brand, advertisement, promotional offer, etc.

**Project Flow**
We will handle this problem in a structured way.
